How to Run
I chose bun as an alternative package manager to yarn and npm for this project.

To install dependencies, run: bun install.
To execute a specific phase, run: bun run phases/1.ts.

My Thought Process
In developing this project, my focus was on maintaining type-safety by utilizing enums for repetitive string names and incorporating conditional logic into generic types. This approach enhances code reliability and readability.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

/utils.ts: Contains utility functions.
/types.ts: Holds type definitions.
/phases: Contains challenges organized by phases.
